                    <p>The Venator-class Star Destroyer, also known as a Republic attack cruiser or Jedi Cruiser, was the wedge-shaped Capital ship utilized by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. The backbone of the Republic Navy, the Venator was a versatile capital ship able to fill the roles of both a warship, capable of ship to ship combat, as well as the role of a carrier with its impressive starfighter complement against the forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, in some of the most well-known battles of the Clone Wars, including those of Sullust, Christophsis and Coruscant.
